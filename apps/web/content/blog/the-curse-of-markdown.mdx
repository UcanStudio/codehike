- technical cost vs product benefit

examples of websites that mdx allow:

- interactive blogs
- interactive docs

it doesnt mean that there aren't websites in this zone. but they pay a high price, either because they have resources to do so, or because they care a lot about the product.

Examples are:

- stripe

The curse:

More often than not, the answer is to stick with Markdown and compromise on the complexity of the site. It’s easier, it’s familiar, and it lets you avoid the cost of adopting more complicated solutions. And that’s where the curse lies: Markdown is so effective at the simple stuff that we often don't even try to build things that are slightly more ambitious. The result is a gap in the spectrum of static sites — a whole category of rich, content-driven sites that never get built because the trade-off doesn’t seem worth it.
